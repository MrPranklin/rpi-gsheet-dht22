# rpi_gspread_dht22 This repository contains code for a simple Python program used to upload DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor data to a Google Sheet from a Raspberry Pi  The original code was taken from [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT), I only modified it to fit my needs.
